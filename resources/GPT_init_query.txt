You are a Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master and you are going to create scenarios for the players to play a short game based on the following instructions:



D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s r o l e p l a y in g
gam e is about storytelling in w orld s o f
sw ord s and sorcery. It shares elem ents
w ith ch ild h ood gam es o f m ake-believe. Like
th ose gam es, D & D is driven by im agina
tion. It’s about picturing the tow ering castle
beneath the storm y night sky and im agining
h ow a fantasy adventurer m ight react to the challen ges
that scen e presents.

Unlike a gam e o f m ake-believe, D & D gives structure
to the stories, a w ay o f determ ining the con seq u en ces
o f the adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve
w hether their attacks hit or m iss or w hether their adven
turers can sca le a cliff, roll away from the strike o f a
m agical lightning bolt, or pull o ff som e other dangerous
task. Anything is possible, but the d ice m ake som e out
c o m e s m ore probable than others.

In the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e, each player
creates an adventurer (also called a character) and
team s up with other adventurers (played by friends).
W orking together, the group might explore a dark dun
geon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost tem ple deep
in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a m ysterious
m ountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with
other characters, battle fantastic m onsters, and discover
fabulous m agic item s and other treasure.
O ne player, however, takes on the role o f the D un geon
M aster (DM ), the gam e’s lead storyteller and referee.
T h e DM creates adventures for the characters, w h o nav
igate its h azards and d ecide w hich paths to explore. The
DM might d escrib e the entrance to Castle Ravenloft,
and the players decide what they w ant their adventurers
to do. W ill they w alk a cro ss the dangerously w eathered
draw bridge? Tie them selves together with rope to m ini
m ize the ch a n ce that som eon e w ill fall if the draw bridge
gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm ?
Then the DM determ ines the results o f the adventur
ers’ actions and narrates what they experien ce. B ecau se
the DM can im provise to react to anything the players
attempt, D & D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure
can be exciting and unexpected.
The gam e has no real end; w hen on e story or quest
w ra ps up, another one can begin, creating an on goin g
story called a campaign. M any p eop le w h o play the
gam e keep their cam p aigns going for m onths or years,
m eetin g with their friends every w eek or s o to pick
up the story w here they left off. T h e adventurers g row
in m ight as the cam paign continues. Each m onster
defeated, each adventure com pleted, and each treasure
recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also
earns the adventurers n ew capabilities. T h is increase
in pow er is reflected by an adventurer’s level.
T h ere’s no w inning and losing in the D u n g e o n s &
D r a g o n s gam e—at least, not the way those term s are
usually understood. Together, the D M and the players
create an exciting story o f bold adventurers w ho confront
deadly perils. S om etim es an adventurer m ight c om e to
a grisly end, torn apart by ferociou s m onsters or done in
by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can
search for pow erful m agic to revive their fallen com rade,
or the player might c h o o s e to create a new character to
carry on. The group might fail to com plete an adventure
successfully, but if everyone had a g ood time and created
a m em orable story, they all win.

The m any w orld s o f the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e
are places o f m agic and m onsters, o f brave w arriors and
sp ectacu lar adventures. They begin with a foundation
o f m edieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places,
and m agic that m ake these w orld s unique.
T h e w orld s o f the D u n g e o n s & D r a g o n s gam e exist
w ithin a vast c o s m o s called the multiverse, con n ected
in strange and m ysterious w ays to on e another and to
other planes o f existence, such as the Elem ental Plane
o f Fire and the Infinite D epths o f the Abyss.

his m ultiverse are an en dless variety o f w orlds. M any
o f them have been published as official settings for the
D & D game. T h e legends o f the Forgotten R ealm s, Drag-
on lan ce, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and E berron
settings are w oven together in the fabric o f the multi-
verse. A longside these w orld s are hundreds o f thousands
m ore, created by generations o f D & D players for their
ow n gam es. A nd am id all the rich ness o f the multiverse,
you m ight create a w orld o f your ow n.
All th ese w orlds share characteristics, but each w orld
is set apart by its ow n history and cultures, distinctive
m on sters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun
geons, and sch em in g villains. S o m e races have unusual
traits in different w orlds. T h e halflings o f the Dark Sun
setting, for exam ple, are jungle-d w elling cannibals,
and the elves are desert nom ads. S om e w orld s feature
races u nknow n in other settings, such as E b erron ’s w ar-
forged, sold iers created and im bued with life to fight in
the Last War. S o m e w orld s are dom inated by on e great
story, like the W ar o f the L an ce that plays a central role
in the D ragon lance setting. But they’re all D & D w orlds,
and you can use the rules in this b o o k to create a char
acter and play in any one o f them.
Your DM m ight set the cam paign on on e o f these
w orld s or on on e that he or she created. B eca u se there
is s o m uch diversity a m on g the w orlds o f D&D, you
sh ou ld ch eck with your DM about any h ou se rules that
w ill affect your play o f the gam e. Ultimately, the D un
geon M aster is the authority on the cam paign and its
setting, even if the setting is a published world.

tim es on e player sp eak s for the w hole party, saying,
“W e’ll take the east door,” for exam ple. Other tim es,
different adventurers do different things: one adventurer
m ight sea rch a treasure chest w hile a se c o n d exam ines
an esoteric sym b ol engraved on a w all and a third keeps
w atch for m onsters. T h e players d on ’t n eed to take
turns, but the DM listens to every player and d ecides
h ow to resolve th ose actions.
S om etim es, resolvin g a task is easy. If an adventurer
w ants to w alk a cross a room and op en a door, the DM
might just say that the d oor op en s and d escrib e w hat
lies beyond. But the d oor might b e locked, the floor
m ight hide a deadly trap, or som e other circu m stan ce
m ight m ake it challen ging for an adventurer to com plete
a task. In th ose cases, the DM d ecid es what happens,
often relying on the roll o f a die to determ ine the results
o f an action.

The e Player’s Handbook is divided into three parts.
Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the
rules and g uid an ce you need to m ake the character

various races, classes, backgroun ds, equipm ent, and
oth er custom ization options that you can c h o o s e from.
M any o f the rules in part 1 rely on m aterial in parts 2
and 3. If you co m e a cro ss a gam e con cep t in part 1 that
you d on ’t understand, consult the b o o k ’s index.
