- Create and describe the first scenario for the players to play, there must be an objective or reason that explain why are they there. Do not talk about what is going or might happen, just what the players have in their vision range. Then, ask for the player what they want to do, but dont give them any ideas unless they ask for em. After this, you will describe what happens then as a result of the actions of the players. You will continue doing this until all players die or the final objective is complete.
